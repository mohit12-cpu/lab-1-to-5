# Lab-1-to-5

##  Overview

This repository contains HTML files for lab assignments 1 through 5. Each lab (lab1, lab2, … lab5) is implemented in its respective HTML file. Additionally, there are supporting files such as tables (`first table.html`, `secondtable.html`) and an index file (`index.html`) for navigation.  

Use this repository as a reference or starting point for similar lab assignments in web/HTML-based courses or tutorials.


##  How to Use

1. Clone this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohit12-cpu/lab-1-to-5.git
2. Open index.html in a web browser — this will give an overview/navigation for all labs.

3. Click on any labX.html (or other HTML file) to view the content of that lab.

Note: Since this project consists solely of static HTML files, there are no build steps or dependencies. Just opening the HTML files in a browser is sufficient.

 What this Project Demonstrates

Basic usage of HTML for structuring content.

Use of tables and navigation across multiple HTML pages.

Organisation of multiple independent lab assignments in a single, coherent repo.

 How to Extend / Customise

You can use this repository as a template for future lab assignments or small web projects. To extend:

Add new lab files (e.g. lab6.html, lab7.html, etc.)

Update index.html to include links to new labs

Add assets (CSS, images, JS) if you want to style or expand functionality
